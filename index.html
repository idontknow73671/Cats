        <h2>Siberian Cats</h2>
        <body>
            <h2>What Siberian cats are known for</h2>
            <h3>Ancient Origins: The Siberian cat is an ancient breed that originated in Russia. These forest cats have a rich history, even appearing in centuries-old Russian fairy tales and childrens books.</h3>
            <h3>Luxurious Triple Coats: Siberians sport luxurious triple coats that protect them against the cold. Their fur is dense and water-resistant, making them well-suited for chilly climates.</h3>
            <h3>and Affectionate: Siberian cats have an outgoing and affectionate personality. They thrive on companionship and make exceptional furry friends. Whether youre a human, another cat, or a dog, theyll likely get along with you.</h3>
            <h3>Playful and Curious: These felines are smart and athletic. They enjoy playtime, climbing, and exploring. Be prepared for their kitten antics to last longer than in other breeds, as they take about 5 years to mature.</h3>
            <h3>Potential: While not scientifically proven, some consider Siberian cats to be hypoallergenic. Cat dander, urine, and saliva (not necessarily cat hair) are the main culprits for allergies. Siberians may produce less of the protein FelD1, which could make them more tolerable for mild allergy sufferers.</h3>
            <h3>Strong Bonds: Siberians tend to form strong bonds with their human companions. Their loyalty and friendly nature make them a joy to have around.</h3>

    <h2>Ragdoll cats</h2>
        <body>
            <h2>What Ragdoll cats are known for</h2>
            <h3>Gentle and Laid-Back: Ragdolls live up to their name. When you pet them, they go limp with pleasure, making them ideal lap cats. Their easygoing temperament and social nature make them wonderful companions.</h3>
            <h3>Large and Beautiful: These cats are big, with males weighing up to 20 pounds. Their striking features include big blue eyes and a loud, throaty purr that reveals their soft-hearted nature.</h3>
            <h3>Social Butterflies: Ragdolls thrive in bustling households with plenty of people and friendly pets. They crave human attention and enjoy being near their families.</h3>
            <h3>Colorpoint Coats: Ragdolls have a semi-long, silky soft coat with colorpoint patterns (such as seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, and cream). Their fur doesnâ€™t mat easily.</h3>
            <h3>History: Developed in California during the 1960s by breeder Ann Baker, ragdolls were appreciated for their non-matting fur, large size, and outgoing personalities. The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) began registering them in 1993, and they remain consistently popular.</h3>

            <h2>Tigers</h2>
                <body>
                    <h2>What Tigers are known for</h2>
                    <h3>Distinctive Appearance:
                        Tigers are most recognizable for their striking black stripes on vibrant orange fur, which provides effective camouflage in their natural habitats.
                        Their white undersides further accentuate this captivating pattern.</h3>
                    <h3>Largest Living Cat Species:
                        Tigers hold the title of being the largest living cat species.
                        They belong to the genus Panthera and are apex predators.</h3>
                    <h3>Powerful Hunters:
                        Tigers possess sharp teeth, strong jaws, and agile bodies.
                        They are formidable hunters, relying entirely on a diet of meat.
                        The largest recorded tiger was an Amur tiger.</h3>
                    <h3>Speed and Stealth:
                        When hunting, tigers can reach speeds of up to 65 km/hr (approximately 40 mph).
                        Their beautiful coats aid in nighttime camouflage during stealthy pursuits.</h3>
                    <h3>Territorial Solitude:
                        Tigers are generally solitary but social predators.
                        They require large contiguous areas of habitat to meet their needs for prey and raising offspring.
                        Tiger cubs stay with their mothers for about two years before establishing their own territories.</h3>

                    <h2>Lions</h2>
                        <body>
                            <h2>What Lions are known for</h2>
                            <h3>Physical Characteristics:
                                Lions (Panthera leo) are the second-largest cats in the world, following tigers.
                                They have a muscular, broad-chested body, a short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of their tail.
                                Adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</h3>
                            <h3>Social Behavior:
                                Lions are social animals that form groups called prides.
                                A pride typically consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
                                Female lions often hunt together, primarily preying on large ungulates.</h3>
                            <h3>Habitat and Distribution:
                                Lions inhabit grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands.
                                Historically, they ranged throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa and India.
                                Lions are diurnal, although they can adapt to being active at night when necessary.</h3>
                            <h3>Apex Predators:
                                Lions are apex and keystone predators, playing a crucial role in their ecosystems.
                                While they may scavenge opportunistically, they typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</h3>
                            <h3>Conservation Status:
                                Unfortunately, lion populations have declined significantly due to habitat loss and conflicts with humans.
                                Since the early 1990s, African lion populations have decreased by about 43%, leading to their listing as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
                                Efforts to protect designated areas are essential for their survival.</h3>

                            <h2>Sphynx cats</h2>
                                <body>
                                    <h2>What Sphynx cats are known for</h2>
                                    <h3>Lack of Fur: The most obvious feature is their absence of fur. This hairlessness is a natural genetic mutation that occurred spontaneously. Their skin has a texture similar to chamois leather and may have fine hairs or be completely hairless.</h3>
                                    <h3>Appearance:
                                        Wedge-Shaped Head: Sphynx cats have somewhat wedge-shaped heads with prominent cheekbones.
                                        Large Eyes and Ears: They boast large lemon-shaped eyes and very large ears (with hair on the inside and soft down on the outside base).
                                        Long Legs and Tail: Their legs and tail are quite long, and they have neat, rounded paws.
                                        Skin Color and Markings: Their skin color corresponds to what their fur would be, and all usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may appear on their skin.</h3>
                                    <h3>Warmth and Seeking Heat:
                                        Due to their lack of fur, Sphynx cats lose body heat more readily than coated cats. As a result, they feel warm to the touch and often seek out warm places.</h3>
                                    <h3>Breed History:
                                        The contemporary Sphynx breed developed through selective breeding starting in the 1960s.
                                        Foundation cats came from two lines of natural mutations: the Dermis and Epidermis barn cats from Minnesota and stray cats found in Toronto, Canada.
                                        The Canadian Sphynx breed began in Toronto when a hairless male kitten named Prune was born in 1966. Prune was mated with his mother, leading to the first attempt to create a hairless breed.
                                        </h3>
                                    <h3>Playful and Goofy:
                                        Despite their regal appearance, Sphynx cats are playful and goofy pals. They sometimes exhibit behaviors more typical of dogs than cats.</h3>
